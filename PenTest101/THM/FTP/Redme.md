- What is FTP?
  FTP is a File Transfer Protocol used to allow remote file transfer over a network. It uses a client server models to do this and relays commands and data in a very efficient way.

- How does FTP work?
  A typical FTP session operations using two channels, A command and a data channel. The data channel is used for transmitting commands as well as replies to those commands along with the data.

  FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a connection with the server and validates any credentials provided and then opens a session.

  While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the server.

- Active v.s Passive

  - Active: The client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it.
  - Passive: The server opens a port and listens and the client connects to it.

    This separation of command information and data into separate channels is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having to wait for the current data transfer to finish. If both channels are interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers. This wouldn't be efficient for either large files transfers or slow internet connections.
