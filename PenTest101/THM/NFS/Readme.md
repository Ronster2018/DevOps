# NFS

- What is an NFS:
  NDF stands for Network File System. This allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network.
  By using an NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems. It does this by mounting all or a portion of a filesystem on a server.
  The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.
- How does an NFS work?
  First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory the same way it can mount a physical drive. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.
  The server checks if the user has permission to mount the directory that has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory on the server.
  IF someone wants access to a file using NFS, an PRC call is places to NFSD( the NFS daemon ) on the server.
  This call takes parameters such as:
  - The file handle
  - The name of the file to be accessed
  - The users ID
  - The users Group ID.
- What runs NFS?
  Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and, Linux, MacOS, or Unix.
  A computer running Windows server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.
