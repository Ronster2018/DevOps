# SMTP

- What is SMTP:
    - **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol** handles sending emails. To support email services, a protocol pair is required. That;s made up of both SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together, they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail respectively.

- What does SMTP do?
    - The SMTP server performs three basic funcitons
        * it verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server
        * it sends the outgoing mail
        * if the outgoing mail cant be delivered, it send the message back to the sender. 

- What are POP and IMAP
    - **Post Office Protocol** and **Internet Message Access Protocol** are both mail protocols that are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and a mail server. 
     - POP is a simplistic approach of downloading the inbox from the mail server to the client
     - IMAP will sync the current inbox with new mail on the server, only downloading what's new. 
- How does SMTP work?
    -   The user supplies an email, a service will deliver it to the recipients inbox. The role of the SMTP server in this service is to act as the sorting office. The email is sent to this server which then directs it to the recipient. 

    User -> SMTP Server -> WWW -> POP / IMAP Server -> Recipient

1. The mail user agent, which is either your email client or an external program. connects to the SMTP server of your domain, e.g. smtp.google.com. This initiates the SMTP handshake. This connection works over the SMTP port- which is usually 25. Once these connections have been made and validated, the SMTP session starts.

2. The process of sending mail can now begin. The client first submits the sender, and recipient's email address- the body of the email and any attachments, to the server.

3. The SMTP server then checks whether the domain name of the recipient and the sender is the same.

4. The SMTP server of the sender will make a connection to the recipient's SMTP server before relaying the email. If the recipient's server can't be accessed, or is not available- the Email gets put into an SMTP queue.

5. Then, the recipient's SMTP server will verify the incoming email. It does this by checking if the domain and user name have been recognised. The server will then forward the email to the POP or IMAP server, as shown in the diagram above.

6. The E-Mail will then show up in the recipient's inbox.

## Enumeration

- Poorly configured mail servers often provide an initial foothold into a network. Prior to launching an attach, we want to fingerprint the server. Here, we will use *smtp_version*, a MetaSploit module. 

- The SMTP service has two internal commands that allows us to enumerate users:
    * VRFY: confirm the names of valid users
    * EXPN: reveals actual address of user's aliases and lists of email.
    With using these SMTP commands, we can reveal a list of users.

- We can do this manually over a telnet connection however, Metasploit can also be used. *smto_enum* will do the initial work for us. 

### MetaSploit
- Drop into the msfconsole
- Search for out exploit *smtp_version*
    ```bash
    msf6> search smtp_version
    ```
- Use the Aux smtp scanner
    ```bash
    msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version
    ```
- Set the RHOSTS
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS 10.10.x.x
    ```
- Output:
    ```bash
    msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smtp/smtp_version) > exploit

    [+] 10.10.193.219:25      - 10.10.193.219:25 SMTP 220 polosmtp.home ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)\x0d\x0a
    [*] 10.10.193.219:25      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
    [*] Auxiliary module execution completed
    ```
